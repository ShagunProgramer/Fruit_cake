1. CAKE BASE:
You can use your favourite Vanilla or Chocolate cake recipe as the base.
 I have tweaked a few things in that recipe to make an entirely different cake base.

And why so?
Because that was a really basic recipe using just oil and water. Though I were satisfied completely with that recipe I had few of our readers doubting the same because of its simplicity.

So I thought of making a few basic changes in that recipe and make an entirely new one for you guys. Have changed the quantity of water and used milk and yogurt in it. Also, have increased the amount of dry flour.

What difference did that make?
This time the cake was super moist and soft comparatively. I guess it was due to the addition of yogurt. The only thing my cake turned little brown in colour. Still tryingto figure out the reason for the same. However, I am totally satisfied with the recipe.

Will I use this recipe in my future cakes?
Yes, definitely. It was totally worth it.

You can also make cake base out of premix if you desire.


2. SUGAR SYRUP
It's a child's play to make sugar syrup. Simply combine equal portions of sugar and boiling water that's it.

A very simple yet a crucial ingredient to keep the cake moist for 2-3 days ðŸ˜€

3. WHIPPED CREAM
That cloud like melt in your mouth frosting is to just die for!!

I have followed my Stabilized Whipped Cream recipe here too. If you are a beginner I highly recommend you guys to check that post it is packed with tons of information ðŸ˜€

4. CHOCOLATE GANACHE
This is totally optional. I have used a white chocolate ganache which is made of chocolate and cream just to enhance the look of the cake and colour to act as a contrast to the white cake and berries.

5. AND OF COURSE FRESH FRUITS
To make fresh fruit cake you would obviously need fresh fruits right.

Here is the list of fruits that I like to include in my Fresh Fruit Cake:
Pineapple, Apples, Grapes, All kinds of berries, Mandarins, Oranges, Kiwi, Pomegranate, Apricots, Peaches, Mango etc. depending upon the availability of fresh fruits. What you are aiming for is good sturdy fruit.

I tend to avoid soft, mushy and juicy fruits like watermelon, banana, etc in fruit cake with fresh fruit.
